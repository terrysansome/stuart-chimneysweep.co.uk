    <h2>Welcome to StoneHutt Business Solutions</h2>
    <p class="sub"> Why StoneHutt you may ask? Well, it is an amalgam of the names of two like-minded marketing individuals Mike Stoneham and Nick Hutton, who have decided to branch out on their own, using their considerable business, marketing and direct marketing experience, skills and knowledge.</p> 
    
    <h3>Sub Header</h3>
    <p>StoneHutt provides a dedicated consultancy service specialising in business and marketing development, customer experience, strategy, planning and implementation, to help improve the efficiency, performance and profitability of SME companies in both B2C and B2B sectors. Recent consultancy includes a diversity of sectors from South African wines, educational and office furniture, to mail order and even the NHS!</p>
    
    <h3>Sub Header</h3>
    <p>StoneHutt business philosophy believes in achieving ‘success through people’. More often than not the ingredients for improvement in performance are already there – they just need someone to look at them through an experienced independent eye and a catalyst to harness the strengths, build on the existing base, identify and implement opportunities internally and externally, and bring everything together in a structured workable set of solutions that are right for your specific company. It is not about ‘reinventing the wheel’ but StoneHutt Business Solutions can be that catalyst for sustained long term success.</p>

    <p>Whilst it is the longer term business planning, objectives and strategic development that drive improvement, it is also the medium and short term plans which are equally important to help achieve sustained growth and profitability. The integration and right blend of business and marketing is fundamental to continued success.</p>
    
    <h3>Business Solutions</h3>
    
    <p>StoneHutt specialises in three key business areas</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Business Strategy and development</li>
    <li>Integrated Marketing and Direct Marketing</li>
    <li>Achieving success through people</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>For a consultancy to facilitate successful outcomes, it is essential to have a sound grasp of what the company is all about. That means not only reading and researching background information, but spending time with key people in the organisation at all levels, to help understand the structure, the processes and the outcomes. </p>
    
    <p>Do you have a Business Plan which is up to date and driving your operational plans? Do you have cost effective and integrated Marketing Plans that produce measurable results? Do you have a catalogue and advertising which need refreshing? Do you need to generate more leads to drive top line sales? Are you happy with your margins? These are just a few of the many areas where StoneHutt Business Solutions can help.</p>
    
    <p>StoneHutt can offer an end-to-end service and work closely with you to help achieve your objectives or we can look at a specific need where you perhaps don’t have the
    right internal skills or resources. Whatever your need, you will find the process stimulating and challenging. Your success is our success.</p>
